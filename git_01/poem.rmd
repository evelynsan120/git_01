## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
THERE are certain things  
as, a spider, a ghost,  
The income-tax, gout,  
an umbrella for three  
That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most  
Is a thing they call the Sea.
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both  
And be one traveler, long I stood  
And looked down one as far as I could  
To where it bent in the undergrowth;    

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  
The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun.  
  
## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
Little snail,  
Dreaming you go.  
Weather and   
Is all you know.  
Weather and rose  
Is all you see,  
Drinking  
The dewdropâ€™s  
Mystery.
